      <h2>Exercises</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="../week9/team/index-START.html">Team: Drum kit</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The drum kit was a lot of fun. I imported some music from iTunes and replaced the wav files with m4p files. It worked really well! Unfortunately, I felt I had to remove them. I left the names, but the sound is gone.</p>
      <h2>Brief Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>window.x === x, but it is easier to just use x</li>
        <li>.confirm creates a pop-up that asks if you want to proceed.</li>
        <li>.confirm, .alert, and .prompt are not recommended because they can be blocked.</li>
        <li>Cookies are small files that are saved locally.</li>
        <li>document.cookies shows what is in the cookie.</li>
        <li>data- can be used to embed data with custom attributes.</li>
        <li>APIs let us pull in information.</li>
